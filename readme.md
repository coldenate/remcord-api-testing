# Testing Grounds for RemCord RemNote Plugin

This is a testing ground for my work with the Discord API and RemCord, a plugin for RemNote. This plugin is still in development, and is not yet ready for use with the API side of things, but the helper application still gets the job done very well.

<h3 align="center">This repo basically outlines my research into the Discord API because I cannot seem to grasp an understanding of it online and I need to learn it for RemCord. <img src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/6220c51b06fd6a9f5be613b4/1x.gif"></h3>

Cheers!
