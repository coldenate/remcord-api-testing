# RemCord Token Exchange Server

		<summary>Information and help on using Activities.write/read scope (See activities-example branch)</summary>
		<br>
		This repo is made because I found little documentation for the `activities.write/read` scope, and I wanted to learn how to use it. So feel free to use this repo as a reference for your own projects, or to learn how to use the Discord API. It's not the best, but it's something, and I'll try to fix it up to make it look better.
		<h3>This repo basically outlines my research into the Discord API because I cannot seem to grasp an understanding of it online and I need to learn it for RemCord.</h3>
